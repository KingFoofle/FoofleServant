# FoofleServant

FoofleBot was developed using the JavaScript language, and utilizes Discord.js as middleware to allow communication between the Bot and Discord. Currently the bot can operate with minimal functionality, such as being able to track user currency, and ban/kick/unban members on command. More features are planned to come.

User data is stored on a MongoDB database. However, the bot will never ask for your personal data, thus, no personal data (such as your name or date or birth) is stored. Regardless, precautions will be taken to ensure that data is secure.
